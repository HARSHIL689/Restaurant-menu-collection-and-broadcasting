# Restaurant-menu-collection-and-broadcasting
This is a full stack project made with react and springboot.

The application will take menu items from restaurents and tifin services through whatsapp.
The system will parse and process all menus.
System will broadcast the messages to users.
The users will reply with "number of users coming" "address" etc.
System will process these replies and send it to the restaurent or tifin service.
We have used whatsapp api to take menus and to reply to the tiffin services.
The communication with whtsapp makes it easy for the tiffin services or restaurents to take orders rather than handling multiple calls and messages from different customers.
